# Linux device driver

This repository is exercising some Linux kernel module to an embedded device

We will do it from the most simple kernel module, hello world

Outline:
1. Hello World
2. Pseudo Character Driver
    - There are three phases in this project 
    - The first phase is create a pseudo character device
    - The second phase is create a multiple device nodes
    - The third phase is create a platform driver
3. GPIO driver
4. Virtual I2C driver
5. Pseudo Platform Driver
6. MISC character driver
